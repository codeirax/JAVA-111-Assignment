final --> final keyword means we can't extend any further class and also we 
can't override any method or member if we have used final signature.

finally --> This keyword means we can execute last statement in try catch block explicitly.


class A.java
=====================
final class A{
  System.out.println("I am inside class A");
}

if user will try to extends it won't extends

class B extends A{  // Here class B can't inherited.
  
}



class Tester.java
=================================
public class Tester {
   public static void main(String[] args) {

      try{
      
         int a = 10;
         int b = 0;
         int result = a/b;
         
      }catch(Exception e){
         System.out.println("Error: "+ e.getMessage());
      }
      finally{
         System.out.println("Finished.");
      }
   }
}


Output
Error: / by zero
Finished.          // This output will always come whether program handled or not any exception this why because
we have used finally keyword.
